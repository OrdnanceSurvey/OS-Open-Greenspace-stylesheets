# OS Open Greenspace

These are QML files for OS Open Greenspace in ESRI Shapefile format for use in QGIS.

*The stylesheets have been designed to work with the data loaded into a database, e.g. PostGIS, with fieldnames in full and in lowercase.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Greenspace-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**3.**  Open QGIS.

**3.**  Click on the ‘Add Vector Layer’ button and navigate to your data.

**4.**  Select the data and click ‘OK’

**5.**  Double-click on each layer in turn to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the matching QML file > click 'Open' > click 'OK'


We recommend viewing of the map between **1:2,400** and **1:30,000** for maximum legibility.

We recommend viewing the data with OS OpenMap Local and/or OS VectorMap District in Backdrop style.



Your map should now look similar to this:

## Compatibility notes

We strive to make our QML files compatible with the latest long-term release of QGIS
