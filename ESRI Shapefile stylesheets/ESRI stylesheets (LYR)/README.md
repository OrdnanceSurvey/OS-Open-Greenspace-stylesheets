# OS Open Greenspace

These are LYR files for OS Open Greenspace in ESRI Shapefile format for use in ESRI ArcGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Greenspace-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  In ArcMap, right-click on ‘Layers’ at the top of the Table Of Contents, select Properties… > then under the Coordinate System tab > choose British National Grid. You may need to reposition to the data extent

**3.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference

**4.**  Select the layer file and click ‘Add’

**5.**  Double-click on a layer to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > select the ‘Source tab’ > click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your OS Open Greenspace data > select relevant dataset > select ‘Add’

Repeat step 5 for all layers if they don't link automatically.

We recommend viewing of the data between **1:2,400** and **1:30,000** for maximum legibility.

We recommend viewing the data with OS OpenMap Local and/or OS VectorMap District in Backdrop style.



Your map should now look similar to this:
